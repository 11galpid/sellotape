# sellotape

Sellotape is a modern audio podcast platform.
It introduces an accessible way to listen to podcast and audio streams.

As a podcaster/streamer, you can create your private radio. By accessing your user endpoint, anyone who wants to listen can join your podcast, live djset, or whatever it is you want it to be heard.

As a listener, you can follow your favourite streamers and keep up to date with their streams.

## Project structure
The platform strives to be a simple social network as users can follow each other and go live whenever they wish to do so.
When user x logs in, it will display an "infinite feed" of scheduled and previous streams of users followed by user x.
At a specific user page, you can view his archived streams and some basic contact information to further connect with him.

Our philosophy is that there should be no alienation between a streamer and a listener, and we engage and strive to push the interaction between them as possible.
